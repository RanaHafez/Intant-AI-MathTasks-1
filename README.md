## Task 1

linear vs non-linear data
* creates a straight line curve 
* there is a direct correlation between an independent variable and a dependent variable
* creates a curve 

## Task 3
* Probability sampling involves random selection, allowing you to make strong statistical inferences about the whole group.
* meannign that every member of the population has a change of being selected. used in quantitve research
* it has 4 main types:
   * simple random sample (having equal chances of being selected)
   * systematic sample (individuals are chosen at regular intervals)
   * stratified sample (dividing the population into subpopulations that may differ in important ways)
   * cluster sample (Cluster sampling also involves dividing the population into subgroups, but each subgroup should have similar characteristics to the whole sample.)

* Non-probability sampling involves non-random selection based on convenience or other criteria, allowing you to easily collect data.
In a non-probability sample, individuals are selected based on non-random criteria, and not every individual has a chance of being included.
  * easier and cheaper than the probability 
  * has a higher risk of sampling bias
  * usually used in exploratory and qualitative research
  * main types:
      - Convenience sampling
      - Voluntary response sampling
      - Purposive sampling
      - Snowball sampling
      - Quota sampling
